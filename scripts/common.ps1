.SYNOPSIS
    The helpers the release and verification scripts share.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this beside patch-target.ps1 and patch-report.ps1:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'common.ps1')

    Each of these existed in two to four copies that had already drifted apart. The path guard
    was identical in three scripts; the cleanup helper recursed unconditionally in one and only
    on request in another; the version read appeared four times, twice without -LiteralPath; and
    the desktop CLI was looked up by two functions with different search orders, one returning
    $null and one throwing. Copies of a guard drift in the direction of whichever caller was
    edited last, which is the direction nobody checked.

        the patches module and its submodules (patches/src/main, patches/<submodule>/src/main,
        the compile-only stubs among them, whose constants can be inlined into patch code), the
        sources of every extension module (extensions/<module>/src/main and
        extensions/<module>/<submodule>/src/main), the Gradle files that shape them, the R8
        rules (*.pro at extensions/ and in each module, extensions/proguard-rules.pro being the
        one every extension's R8 step reads), and NOTICE, which :extensions:pinterest compiles
        into the payload for its Licenses row. Build output is never under src/main, so it is not
        walked. build-release-receipt.ps1 refuses a bundle this finds anything newer than.

function Enter-HushPinterestQueue {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Waits for a slot in the machine's build queue for one heavy job, or returns $null at once
        when BUILD_QUEUE_SCRIPT names no queue. Hand what it returns to Exit-HushPinterestQueue in
        a finally block.
    .DESCRIPTION
        A CLI patch run, a split bundle merge and the resource table and dex checks each start a
        JVM with a heap of 4 to 8 GB. Started beside the Gradle builds the queue already holds,
        they ran on the same cores, and build-queue.ps1 -Status never showed them. The script
        BUILD_QUEUE_SCRIPT names defines Enter-BuildQueue, Exit-BuildQueue and
        Get-BuildQueueMask. The job waits there as "hushpinterest <Job>", then runs on its slot's
        cores at below normal priority, which the JVM it starts inherits. A release run sets
        BUILD_QUEUE_PRIORITY=release, which the queue reads to put it ahead of everyday builds,
        and a job started inside a slot (BUILD_QUEUE_TICKET) goes straight through.

        The queue's Invoke-InBuildQueue takes a script block and sends its output to the host.
        The callers here keep each job's output and read its exit code where they make the call,
        so the queue is entered and left around that call instead.

function Get-BaseApk {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The APK whose manifest and resource table describe an app: the file itself, or the base
        APK a split bundle carries, copied out to -Destination.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Pinterest ships as a split bundle (APKPure's .xapk, APKMirror's .apkm), not as one APK, and
        aapt2 and the resource check read an APK. The base APK holds the manifest and the app's own
        resource table; the splits hold densities, languages and native code. An .apks or .apkm
        names it base.apk. An .xapk names it after the package and says so in its manifest.json,
        and its config.arm64_v8a split can be the larger file, so size alone can pick the wrong
        one. The largest APK that isn't a config or split_ file is the fallback when nothing names
        the base, and the largest of any is the last resort.

        Both paths are resolved against PowerShell's location before .NET sees them, and the
        answer is a full path. .NET reads a relative path against the process's own directory,
        which a hook, a scheduled task or a session that moved with Set-Location leaves somewhere
        else: `-Apk fixtures\pinterest.xapk` then named a file that wasn't there.

    .SYNOPSIS
        The one APK the desktop CLI patches: a split bundle merged the way the CLI merges it,

    .DESCRIPTION
        morphe-desktop merges an .apkm, .apks or .xapk into <name>-merged.apk beside its output,
        patches that, and since 1.17.0 deletes it on the way out. The patched APK's resource table
        and manifest were rebuilt from that merge, so the checks compared them with the base APK
        instead, which lacks every resource the splits carry: on the Facebook sibling's 580 the
        patched table held 7,588 resources base.apk doesn't, and none of them was compared. So the
        scripts merge first,
        with the CLI's own merger and the arguments it passes (MergeSplits.java), and hand the CLI
        the merged APK, which it patches as it is. There is nothing else to fall back to, so a
        merge that fails or writes no APK throws. The extensions are the CLI's own list
        (BundleFormats); anything else goes to the CLI as it is.

function Find-MachineNames {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        The lines of tracked files that name the maintainer's machine or a phone.
    .DESCRIPTION
        The working-notes folder .gitignore keeps out, the backup folders on the maintainer's
        machine that share its name, and an adb serial, a Samsung one being R5C and eight more
        letters or digits. Four fixture tests once fell back to one of those folders, which
        skipped quietly on every other machine and published this one's layout, and five scripts
        carried the test phone's serial. .gitignore is the one file allowed to name what it keeps
        out. Both patterns are built from parts, so the file holding them can't match itself.

        git grep reads bytes, so text in UTF-16 has patterns of its own: every letter followed by a
        NUL for little-endian, the way Windows PowerShell's > writes a file, or preceded by one for
        big-endian. They go through git grep's Perl regexes, which read \x00. A git built without
        them can't search, which throws like any search that doesn't run.

        With -Commit the files are read out of those commits, which is what a push publishes, and
        no worktree is needed: git grep reads them all in one pass and puts the commit in front of
        each hit, <commit>:<path>:<line>:<text>. Without it, the tracked files as they stand in the
        working tree. GIT_* variables are cleared for the search, so it reads the repository -Root
        names, and a search that doesn't run throws rather than reading as a clean tree. Every hit
        comes back as git grep prints it; none at all comes back as nothing, so callers wrap it in @().
